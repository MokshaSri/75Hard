# 75Hard

This is mostly a project for me to learn React Native and brush up on app dev skills! Although it would be helpful for me to track my 75Hard Progress. 

75Hard is a wellness program by Andy Frisella that is meant to boost your confidence, self-esteem, and grit. It consists of a few simple rules. These rules are taken from the 75Hard Subreddit.

Each day you must:

1. Drink 1 gallon (3.8L) of plain water
2. Perform 2 workouts
3. Read 10 pages of a non fiction book that you think will improve something about you.
4. No Alcohol
5. Take a progress pic

And you do it for 75 days! Easy peasy? No? Lol

I've not had a successful run at this ever before, the longest I could get to was 20 days. Maybe strictly writing down my progress will help?
